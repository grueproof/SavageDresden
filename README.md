# Savage Dresden

An adapation of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files Setting for Savage Worlds.

## Background

I wanted to run a game set in the Dresden Files universe, but wanted to use Savage Worlds for the mechanics. And here it is. 

## What's in here?

This inital version is a series of notes on powers, settings, and artifacts mostly. I'm sure they will need refining. In fact, if you use these and have suggestion, send me a PR. Maybe we can make this awesome.


## Licensing

As with [Savage Amber](https://github.com/grueproof/SavageAmber) adaptation, I have no right to make any money of this. I don't own the rights. (Please, Jim, don't sue me).

Additionally, I used AI to assist with some of the mechanics. And I have no idea how that falls when we start talking about copyrights.

That being said, I'm releasing this under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Let's see how that goes.
