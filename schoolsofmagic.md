# New Power Details

## Bind Object
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 2
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* Permanent until dispelled or triggered

Bind Object allows the caster to bind a magical effect or power to an object. When triggered, the bound power activates as if cast by the caster. The triggering condition must be defined when the power is bound. Examples of triggers include touch, a spoken command, or a specific event.

## Divination
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 3
*Range:* Special
*Duration:* Instant

Divination allows the caster to gain insight into past, present, or future events. The caster must specify the target or event they wish to learn about, and the GM determines the success and the amount of information revealed. This power is subject to interpretation and GM discretion.

## Object Reading
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 2
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* Instant

Object Reading allows the caster to gain information about an object's past by touching it. The caster can learn details about the object's previous owners, significant events involving the object, or other relevant information, as determined by the GM.

## Elemental Weapon
*Rank:* Seasoned
*Power Points:* 4
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* 3 (1/round)

Elemental Weapon imbues a touched weapon with an elemental force (fire, ice, lightning, etc.) chosen by the caster. The weapon deals an additional 2d6 damage of the chosen elemental type. Armor Piercing (AP) properties apply to the extra damage as well.

## Protection Circle
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 3
*Range:* Smarts
*Duration:* 1 hour (1/hour)

Protection Circle creates a magical barrier that prevents creatures of a specific type (e.g., demons, ghosts, vampires) from entering or leaving the circle. The circle's radius is equal to the caster's Smarts in inches. Affected creatures cannot cross the circle's boundary unless the circle is broken or dispelled.

## Warding
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 2
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* Permanent until dispelled or triggered

Warding allows the caster to create a magical trap or alarm on a specific object or location. When triggered, the ward can cause a chosen effect, such as dealing damage, alerting the caster, or creating a barrier. The triggering condition must be defined when the ward is placed.

## Clairvoyance
*Rank:* Seasoned
*Power Points:* 4
*Range:* Unlimited
*Duration:* 3 (1/round)

Clairvoyance allows the caster to see and hear events happening at a distant location. The caster must be familiar with the location or have a clear mental image of it. The caster's senses are effectively at the target location, allowing them to perceive events as if they were present.

## Farsight
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 2
*Range:* Self
*Duration:* 3 (1/round)

Farsight enhances the caster's vision, allowing them to see great distances without penalty. The caster ignores all range penalties for visual perception, including those for Shooting or Notice rolls.

## Scrying

*Range:* Special
*Duration:* 3 (1/round)

Scrying allows the caster to remotely view a target by using a focus, such # Drain Life
*Rank:* Seasoned
*Power Points:* 3
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* Instant

Drain Life allows the caster to steal life force from a living target, healing the caster in the process. On a successful Touch attack, the target takes 2d6 damage, and the caster heals half of the damage dealt, rounded down. The target can make a Vigor roll at -2 to resist the effect, taking half damage on a success.

## Ghost Whisper
*Rank:* Novice
*Power Points:* 2
*Range:* Smarts
*Duration:* 3 (1/round)

Ghost Whisper allows the caster to communicate with spirits and ghosts within the range of the caster's Smarts in inches. The caster can ask questions and receive answers, but the information provided is subject to the spirit's knowledge, disposition, and willingness to share.

## Raise Undead
*Rank:* Veteran
*Power Points:* 5
*Range:* Smarts
*Duration:* 1 hour (1/hour)

Raise Undead allows the caster to animate one or more corpses within the range of the caster's Smarts in inches. The undead creatures follow the caster's commands and fight on their behalf. The number and power of the undead creatures raised are determined by the GM and should be balanced for the campaign.

## Soul Binding
*Rank:* Heroic
*Power Points:* 10
*Range:* Touch
*Duration:* Permanent

Soul Binding allows the caster to bind a willing or subdued target's soul to an object, effectively trapping the soul within the object. The target's body remains alive but is in a coma-like state. The soul can be released by destroying the object or through a ritual specified by the GM. The target can attempt a Spirit roll at -4 to resist the effect.
